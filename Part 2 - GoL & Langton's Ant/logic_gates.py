    TODO: [Extension - Logic Gates]
    Instruct the student to:
    1. Initialize a grid and precisely place "Glider" streams (signals represented by gliders)
       such that their collision simulates:
       - An AND gate (produces a specific output pattern only when both inputs A and B are active).
       - A NOT gate (produces an output signal/glider only when input A is inactive).
    2. Prove the Turing completeness of Conway's Game of Life by demonstrating these logic gates.
